    Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise is the most widely used in-memory data grid with hundreds of thousands of installed clusters around the world. It offers caching solutions ensuring that data is in the right place when itâ€™s needed for optimal performance.

    ### Before Your Start

    Add a Secret within the Project that contains the Hazelcast License Key. If you don't have one, get a trial key from this [link](https://hazelcast.com/hazelcast-enterprise-download/trial/).

        $ kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key-secret --from-literal=key=LICENSE-KEY-HERE

    ### Configuration

    For the complete configuration options, please refer to the [Hazelcast Enterprise Helm Chart](https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-enterprise) description.
